# ATMS-597-Project-2-Group-B

Project 2 for ATMS 597 SP 2020.

## Description 
This project uses pandas to organize and view climate data and an API call to a data server at the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) to produce a visualization of climate stripes, created by Ed Hawkins at the University of Reading. Each climate stripe can represent either the annual, monthly, or weekly mean temperature of a specific site called using a GHCN ID. In addition, a time series of the mean temperature is plotted over the stripes as another means of viewing the mean temperature trend.
